# Top15Words
A program that allows you to display the top 15 words from a text file in the form of diagrams. Words are sorted alphabetically.

Description of the logic of the program:
- A file is selected (the "Choose file" button) for frequency analysis of words.
- If the file is readable, then it is read line by line, otherwise a error  dialog is called.
- After a certain period of time, the diagrams are updated until the file is completely read.
- Once the file has been fully read, the diagram contains actual information about the top 15 words in the file.
